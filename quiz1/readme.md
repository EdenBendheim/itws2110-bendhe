While creating the API call I ran into a couple issues.
The first one was when I was trying to output a hardcoded value and I was not able to. 
The issue was that I never closed my select element, so it wasnt showing up.
The way I got around not having a button to change the output was to just have stuff change on the input. The input is USD, and the output is decided by the dropdown. This was not that bad to make, since I just used onclick for the dropdown, and it changes when you type something by using onkeydown.
