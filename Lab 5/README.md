===================

First Speedup
-----------------
My first speedup was to convert all images from the png format, to the fast webp format. I had to convert them online using [Pixelied](https://pixelied.com/convert/png-converter/png-to-webp).


Second Speedup
-----------------
I changed every class that was only used once to an ID, this leads to a slight improvment in loading time.

Third Speedup
-----------------
Along with changing the classes to divs, any unused pieces of unnecessary css were removed in order to speed up loading time more.

Fourth Speedup
-----------------
Compressed css using [Css Compressor](https://csscompressor.com)

Fifth Speedup
-----------------
Minified the JS to make it faster to load [JS Minifier](https://skalman.github.io/UglifyJS-online/)

Sixth Speedup
-----------------
Gave all image tags a src and an alt so the browser does not freak out to find out what they are doing.

Seventh Speedup
-----------------
I cleaned up some of the html, like adding a language to the html, and making sure the headers are in the correct cascading order.

Creative
-----------------
I added a words left counter by adding some JS and html :D.
