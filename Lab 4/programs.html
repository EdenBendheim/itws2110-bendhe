        <h2>Programs</h2>
        <p>Explore the various programs offered by the RPI IT & Web Science Department:</p>
        
        <h3>B.S. in Information Technology and Web Science</h3>
        <p><em>Interdisciplinary From Day One.</em></p>
        <p>In a world in which information technology affects virtually everything we do, there is a demand for an academic program that offers students the deepest understanding of the Web. As an ITWS student, you will investigate issues related to security, trust, privacy, content value, and the development of the Web in the future.</p>
        <p>You will take a core set of courses on Web and IT development and management, along with courses in your focus track, selected from more than 20 options, including arts, engineering, management, communications, artificial intelligence, Web systems, and medicine.</p>
        
        <h4>Curriculum</h4>
        <p>Completion of the B.S. in Information Technology and Web Science requires a total of 128 - 130 credit hours:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>ITWS Core Requirements (24 - 26 credits)</strong><br>
                The ITWS core requirements establish a solid foundation for applying ITWS to any discipline.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Focus Track Requirement (44 credits)</strong><br>
                The required focus track provides an opportunity for in-depth study of an ITWS application area. Focus track options include arts, communication and networks, law, management information systems, medicine, psychology, and numerous others. In consultation with a faculty adviser, students may also design their own focus track through the selection of courses that match their individual interests.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Rensselaer Degree Requirements (60 credits)</strong><br>
                The Rensselaer requirements ensure the degreeâ€™s breadth and its consistency with long-established Rensselaer traditions.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>M.S. in Information Technology</h3>
        <p><em>Solve problems in a data- and information-intensive world.</em></p>
        <p>The Rensselaer M.S. in Information Technology balances the study of management strategies and technology leadership with advanced coursework in an IT concentration. Students complete a suite of core and capstone courses and also select three to five additional courses to complete their concentrations. Professional and research tracks are offered for the M.S. in IT degree.</p>
