Getting Second API to work
I could not get my original second API to work as I kept running into cors issues. My first idea was to get a satellite image of the location using NASA's free Earth API. I got an API key and everything was fine on that end, but I could not get the request to work. 
I kept getting 200 and 503 codes, with the site saying that the request could not be handled. 

The next API I tried was OpenAQ, since I wanted to show more air quality data about the location. This also didnt work for the same reasons mentioned above. Also I could not get a valid API key since the conformation email sent to me was not valid.

I ended up using the Game of thrones API to just get random character info as a sort of fact of the day. I like how it ended up looking. 

I ran into some small css issues getting the css to apply to the HTML that the JS put into the index doc. I ended up just putting the ID's into the html that was being applied through the JS, and that fixed my issues.

I hope you like the site!
